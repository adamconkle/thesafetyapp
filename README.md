<h1>The Safety App</h1>

<h2>Summary</h2>
The Safety App is a tool for managing team collaboration and cmmunication among Safety Team members while on duty at my church. It was built using React Native and Expo.

<h2>File/Folder Notes</h2>
<li>BentoContext.js is the wrapper that allows the sign in screen and the assistance screen to update the status screen.</li>
<li>Node_modules folder is too large to upload here, but I'm not sure if it's needed.</li>

<h2>Versions</h2>
V.1.0.0 - Dec 7, 2024 - Initial project uploaded. Includes working Sign in screen, Status screen, and Assistance screen. Tested using Expo Go. 

Coming soon:
<li>User Statuses of every local church team member should display on every device that is signed in.</li>
<li>Different churches/groups only see their own group's statuses. </li>
